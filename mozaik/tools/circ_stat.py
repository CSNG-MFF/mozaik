    Circular mean of matrix. Weighted if weights are not none.

    Parameters
    ----------
    
    matrix : ndarray
           Matrix of data for which the compute the circular mean. 
           
    weights : ndarray, optional
            If not none, matrix of the same size as matrix. It will be used as weighting for the mean.
    
    low, high : double, optional
              The min and max values that will be mapped onto the periodic interval of (0, 2pi).
              
    axis : int, optional
         Numpy axis along which to compute the circular mean. Default is 0.
