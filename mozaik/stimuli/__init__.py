"""
This module defines the API for:
- implementation of stimuli as input to models (see class BaseStimulus)
- identification of stimulus identity 
- function helpers for common manipulation with collections of stimuli

Each stimulus is expected to have a list of parameters which have to uniquely identify the stimulus.
This parameterization is done via the MozaikParametrized package (see :class:`mozaik.tools.mozaik_parametrized.MozaikParametrized`)
that allows to specify parameters with the all above requirements.
For Stimuli objects we will allow only SNumber, SInteger and SString parameter types (see :py:mod:`mozaik.tools.mozaik_parametrized`).
These extend the corresponding parameterized parameters to allow specification of units.

Note that each stimulus can be converted back and forth into a string via the str operator and the :func:`mozaik.tools.mozaik_parametrized.MozaikParametrized.idd` function. 
This allows for efficient storing  and manipulation of stimulus identities. 

Note that *all* such parameters defined in the class (and its ancestors) will
be considered as parameters of the BaseStimulus.
