This package contains MatLab code for analyzing and synthesizing
digital image of visual texture.  The algorithm is described in the
references given at the bottom of this document.  Further information,
as well the most recent versions of the code, are available at

    http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/texture/

Incremental changes to the code are documented in the ChangeLog file.

INSTALLATION

1) download and unpack the code.  You can put the code anywhere on
   your system, but we'll assume it's in a directory named "textureSynth".

2) download and unpack the matlabPyrTools package from
       https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/matlabPyrTools
   This is a collection of tools for multi-scale decomposition of
   images.  You can put the code anywhere on your system, but we'll
   assume it's in a directory named "matlabPyrTools".  Please use version
   1.4 or newer of the matlabPyrTools.

3) Run matlab, and put the matlabPyrTools directory in your path:
   > path('matlabPyrTools', path);

4) The matlabPyrTools distribution includes a MEX subdirectory containing
   binary executables, precompiled for various platforms (SunOS,Solaris,
   Linux,Windows).  You may need to recompile these on your platform.  In
   addition, you should either move the relavent files from the MEX
   subdirectory into the main directory, OR create a link/alias to them,
   OR place the MEX subdirectory in your matlab path.

USING THE SOFTWARE

- To see a demonstration, start Matlab, change directories (using
  "cd") into the textureSynth directory, and execute "example1"
  (without the quotations).  

- If you want to learn how to use the texture analysis and synthesis
  functions, take a look at example1.m and example2.m (these include
  many explanatory comments).

- For a listing of matlab function included in this package, execute 
     "help textureSynth"

- For details on any of the functions, execute "help <name_of_function>"
